# AllEtsy
Etsy/Twitter scraper

I wrote this code to extract data on Etsy shops in the United States from their shops URL. The data is stored into a database using SQLite.
The list of Etsy shops can be found here: https://www.etsy.com/search/shops?page=1.
The Python program uses Twitter's "GET Users/show" REST API. 

Let me know if you have any questions!
